# Fake-News-detection
The spread of fake news is unstoppable with the adoption of different social networks. On Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, people take advantage of fake news to spread rumours, win political benefits and click rates.
Fake news on different platforms is spreading widely and is a matter of serious concern, as it causes social wars and permanent breakage of the bonds established among people. A lot of research is already going on focused on the classification of fake news. 
Detecting fake news is critical for a healthy society, and there are multiple different approaches to detect fake news. From a machine learning standpoint, fake news detection is a binary classification problem; hence we can use traditional classification methods or state-of-the-art Neural Networks to deal with this problem.
We will create a natural language processing application from scratch and deploy it on Flask. In the end, you will have a Fake news detection web app running on your local machine. 

The project is organized in the following structure:

Step1: Load data from Kaggle to Google Colab.

Step2: Text preprocessing.

Step3: Model training and validation.

Step4: Pickle and load model.

Step5: Create a Flask APP and a virtual environment.

Step6: Add functionalities.
